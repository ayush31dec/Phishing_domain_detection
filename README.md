## Problem Statement

Phishing is a type of fraud in which an attacker impersonates a reputable company or person in order o get sensitive information such as login credentials or account information via email or other communication channels. Phishing is popular among attackers because it is easier to persuade someone to click a malicious link that appears to be authentic than it is to break through a computer's protection measures. 

* The mail goal is to predict whether the domains are real or malicious.
